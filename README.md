# Tip 4: The mantra to prepare

- Initial couple of days: Get the tips (This README has a lot of them). Perhaps refer to gre's videos
- Next 8 days: 
       - Books 7,8,9,10 (2 Tests each day)
       - Sectionwise practice
       - Don't worry about time. Warm up the basics. Identify the errors. Improve the BS
- Next 12 days:
       - Book 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 (2 Tests from each book. If time permits do more tests)

- Take a break for a couple of days

- D-Days

- Go grab a bowl of shahi paneer or butter chicken with paratha or a double cheeze pepparoni pizza. You deserve it!

# Tip 5: Exam Breakdown

## Section 1: Listening

- In a nutshell it is a vocab test. Crunch the words. Ace the test.
- Very strict as compared to TOEFL. Spelling mistakes cannot be avoided. Be laser focussed on the instructions: if it's one word then it's one word that you need provide!
- Each Section has 10 questions
- There are 4 sections
- Look at the questions for 20s
- Questions are in order
- Listen to the passage and start answering
- No one cares about case (Just do it right)

- Things to wrap your head around:

    1. Spellings
    2. Multiple Options out of which one is correct
    3. Change the vocab
    4. Change the order
    5. Multiple Options out of which everything is correct
    6. Speaker would say something wrong and then autocorrect
    7. Additional information to confuse you
    8. Approximations to confuse you (They don't want you to do the math)
    9. Tend to confuse you to write the same answer twice 


- Weird but occassionally helpful tip: Watch British movies and TV Series every day (Bond Series)


# Tip 6: Miscellaneous Tips:

- Visit the centre a couple of days before
- Leave early and be aware that you might get bored
- Don't get intimidated by the speaking test evaluator. They need to understand you.
- Use grammarly for evaluating the writing
